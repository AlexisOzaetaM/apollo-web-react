## Naming branches
There are many types of tasks in a project. Each task has a prefix wich we'll use it to name the branches.
The next table show us the types of tasks, its prefix and an example of branch name.

|   Task  | Prefix |  Example  |                              Obvservation                             |
|:-------:|:------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Develop |   DEV  |  DEV-235  | This task is for any kind of develop for the app.                     |

## Creating branches
All the branches will be created from the **develop branch**.
Follow the next steps:
1.  Create your branch in GitLab from the **develop branch** and name it according to the task prefix and the number of the task.
2.  In your **Git bash** go to the **develop branch** and execute `git pull` to pull the latest changes (and the branches created).
3.  Checkout to your new branch and GO TO WORK, SLAVE!

<a name="MR"><a/>
## Merge Request
A Merge Request is a petition to merge your changes to the **develop branch**. However, that changes have to be accepted for a Mainteiner.
The Mainteiner can reject your changes if consider that it can improve.
Follow the next steps:

2.  Right click an select Git GUI Here
* **Staged changes Area**
    * Here appear the files that you will commit.
* **Unstaged changes Area**
    * Here appear the files that you created, deleted and modified.
    * You can add files to **staged changes area** doing click on the file's icon.
3.  Add all the files that you want to commit.
4.  In **Commit message Area** write a short description of what did you do.
5.  Click on **Commit button*.
6.  Click on **Push button**.
7.  Select **your branch**.
8.  And finally click on **Push button**.

Now, you have to create the **Merge Request** in GitLab.
